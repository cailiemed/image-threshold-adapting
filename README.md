# image-threshold-adapting
These simple codes on Matlab aim to remove letters and annotations from colored images, and then adapt them to the same color threshold, we tested its performance on multicenter breast shear wave elastography images.
codes were written by Dr.Lie Cai and Dr.Andr√© Pfob, codes will be submitted together with our manuscript to IEEE Transactions on Image Processing.
Anyone who used our codes please cite our paper after publication.
The function is named "preprocess", and the implementation script is named "simple process".
